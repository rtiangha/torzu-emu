# Blog Entry 0: Intro

After a week of being unable to check on the project, I realized the onion site had gone down randomly and wouldn't get back up until I rebooted the server. Not ideal. But it's back up now.

Given the lack of innovation and time on my side, I thought it would be a good idea to at least write a short educational blog on the topic.
In this blog, I'll mostly talk about the ins and outs of this emulator, with the hope that someone with more skill than me will eventually be able to pick up where the Torzu project left off. I might also write about personal things, but don't worryâ€”I'll try to keep it low (I've got to keep my anonymity). I'm keeping this blog post short for the sake of it being an intro.

One thing to note is that on this blog, I'll refer to "Torzu" as parts of the emulator written by the original Torzu team and as "Torzu" to the changes I've made and the project itself.

Here's an overview of some of the next topics I'd like to cover on this blog next:

- How I manage a project like this (I'll explain how I operate this project anonymously and what changes I've made to the code to improve its longevity)
- The puzzle pieces (I'll explain the overall concept of the different components of Torzu)
- ARM emulation (I'll explain how Torzu emulates the ARM CPU)

Make sure to also read the [original Torzu blog](https://torzu-mirror.github.io/entry/) if you're interested in this topic!
